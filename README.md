# UFC ELO Engine

## Project Overview

The UFC ELO Engine is a web application designed to calculate and display ELO ratings for UFC fighters. The project aims to provide accurate, dynamic fighter ratings based on their fight history, allowing users to explore detailed profiles and search for specific fighters. The ELO engine simulates the rise and fall of fighter rankings based on their performances in UFC events, capturing key statistics and trends over time. This application also allows users to visualize these ratings, compare fighters, and search through fight data scraped from UFC events.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Vite
  - TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
- **Database**:
  - CSV (scraped data stored in CSV files)
  - JSON (CSV converted to JSON for reading)
  
### Packages Used

- **react-router-dom**: For managing page navigation and routing.
- **csv-write-stream**: Used to write fight data to CSV files.
- **react-chartjs-2**: For visualizing ELO ratings and other fight statistics with charts.
- **axios**: For handling API requests.

## Features

- **Web Scraper**: A Node.js-based scraper collects data from UFC event websites. Using libraries like `axios` for fetching data and `cheerio` for parsing HTML, the scraper gathers key fight stats and stores them in a CSV file. This data serves as the foundation for calculating ELO ratings.
  
- **ELO Engine**: The heart of the application is the ELO rating engine. Written in TypeScript, it processes fight outcomes from the CSV file and calculates a dynamic rating for each fighter. Adjustments were made to account for performance declines, particularly for fighters on losing streaks, such as Anderson Silva and Tony Ferguson. Ratings are recalculated after every fight to reflect fighters' current form.

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for UFC fighters by name, and the search feature returns detailed fighter profiles, including their win-loss history, current ELO rating, and statistics. The search queries the pre-scraped CSV data to find relevant matches.

- **Fighter Profiles**: Each fighter has a dedicated profile page where users can view detailed stats, fight history, and an interactive chart displaying their ELO rating over time. The profiles are built using React and `react-chartjs-2`, offering dynamic and visually rich insights into each fighter's career.

## Building the Web Scraper

The web scraper was built using `axios` to fetch data from the UFC events website, and `cheerio` to parse the HTML and extract relevant fight statistics. The scraper collects data such as fight outcomes, fighter names, and fight dates, which are then written to a CSV file using `csv-write-stream`. The scraper runs periodically to ensure the dataset remains up-to-date with the latest fights.

## Building the ELO Engine

The ELO engine was built in TypeScript. It reads fight data from the CSV file generated by the web scraper and processes each fight using a modified ELO algorithm. The algorithm adjusts fighters' ratings based on the outcome of their fights, accounting for factors like win streaks and losing streaks to simulate a realistic rise and fall in rankings. Special attention was given to handling long-term trends in a fighter's career, with ratings reflecting peak performance periods and eventual declines.

## Building the Search

The search functionality was built using React and TypeScript. The search bar allows users to input fighter names and displays relevant results based on the pre-scraped fight data. The search feature leverages the data stored in the CSV to quickly find and retrieve information, ensuring that searches are efficient and accurate.

## Building the Fighter Profiles

The fighter profile pages are dynamically generated using React components. Each profile pulls data from the CSV file and visualizes key information such as win-loss records and ELO ratings. Using `react-chartjs-2`, the profiles include an interactive chart that tracks the fighter's ELO rating over time, providing users with an engaging way to explore fighter statistics.
